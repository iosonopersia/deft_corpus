Between signals, the neuron membrane's potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	6	0
Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates (i.e., a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	7	0
Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge.

Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	2	0
But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	3	0

Whatever the firm's quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	5	0
As explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are often sunk costs that can not be recouped.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	6	0

Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality and poverty.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	0	0
Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	1	0
Income inequality compares the share of the total income (or wealth) in society that is received by different groups; for example, comparing the share of income received by the top 10% to the share of income received by the bottom 10%.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	2	0
The earned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	3	0

Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	5	0
Generally, households or firms with insurance make regular payments, called premiums.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	6	0
The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	7	0
Another source of financial capital is a bond.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	8	0
A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	9	0
A corporate bond is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	10	0
The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds; stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	11	0
Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the liquidity of the investment, which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	12	0

Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	7	0
Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	8	0
The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	9	0
Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	10	0
Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as shown in <link>.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	11	0
In the neoclassical model, the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) is determined by real economic factors.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	12	0
<link> also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	13	0

Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	16	0
However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	17	0
There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	18	0
For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long-term productivity of a country.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	19	0
These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	20	0
A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	21	0
If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	22	0
When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as crowding out.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	23	0
To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	24	0
The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	25	0
Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	26	0
You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	27	0
For unemployment caused by a recession, the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	28	0
The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase aggregate demand.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	29	0
In a recession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in interest rates.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	30	0
With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	31	0
