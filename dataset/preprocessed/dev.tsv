The forest itself is an ecosystem.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	2
An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	3
At the highest level of organization (<link>), the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	4
Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	5
Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	6
DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as nucleotides.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	7
The nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide, DNA or RNA.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	8
If you examine <link> b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	9
The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	10
Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	11
Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	0
In the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	1
It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	2
An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	3
Natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	4
For example, in <link>, all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	5
Consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a monophyletic group.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	6
Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	7
Evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of Earth's existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there was no molecular oxygen.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	8
Therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygen — anaerobic organisms — were able to live.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	9

Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_404.deft	3
The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_404.deft	4
Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_404.deft	5
The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in <link>.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_404.deft	6

A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	11
A basophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in <link>.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	12
Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	13
During sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	14
The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	15
In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	16

The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	3
This definition also includes re-emerging diseases that were previously under control.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	4
Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	5
Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, and necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	6
The map shows regions where bacterial diseases are emerging or reemerging.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	7
As cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	8
In the 1960s, American biologist Lynn Margulis developed endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	9
In 1967, Margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	10
They vary in their oxygen requirement.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	11
Most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	12
Other species, such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are are obligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	13
Pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte, spreading the plant's genes.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	0
The seed offers the embryo protection, nourishment, and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years, ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	1
Seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	2
Flowers and Fruits as an Evolutionary AdaptationAngiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	3
Both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	4
This leads to the formation of the next developmental stage, the gastrula, in which the future digestive cavity is formed.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	5
Different cell layers (called germ layers) are formed during gastrulation.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	6
These germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types, organs, and organ systems during a process called organogenesis.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	7
Only a few animal groups display radial symmetry.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	8
All types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animal's lifestyle. Radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a drinking glass or pie.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	9
It results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, or front or back.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	10
Examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum Platyhelminthes, also known as flatworms.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	11
Animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates (or coelomates) (<link>).	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	12
A true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	13
The coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely, meaning that during development, a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	14
Deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	15
Here, the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	16
There is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	17
In addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	18
This means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	19
The invertebrates, or invertebrata, are animals that do not contain bony structures, such as the cranium and vertebrae.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	20
The simplest of all the invertebrates are the Parazoans, which include only the phylum Porifera: the sponges (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	21
Soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	0
Soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1 mm are called silt, and even smaller particles, less than 0.002 mm in diameter, are called clay.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	1
Some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand, silt, and humus; these soils are called loams.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	2
As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	4
Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	5
Neural Control of ThermoregulationThe nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in <link>.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	7

Adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	0
It produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	1
Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	2
The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	3
The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	4

PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	2
A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	3
Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	4
A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	5
The Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	6
This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	7
The cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	8
This process is called gastrulation.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	9
During gastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	11
No species exists everywhere; for example, the Venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in North and South Carolina.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	12
An endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	13
Other species are generalists: species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of North and Central America.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	14
The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth's surface.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	15
Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon dioxide rises, global temperature rises.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	16
Since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	18
Many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	19
For example, life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	20
"In fact, while the term ""demographics"" is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach."	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	21
Efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	22
Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	23
"Foundation species are considered the ""base"" or ""bedrock"" of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure."	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	24
They are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	25
For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	26
Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	27
Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	28
For these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	29
Experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	30
A major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	31
Net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	32
Assimilation is the biomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	33
<link> illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the Earth's major water reservoirs.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	35
Residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	36
A large amount of the Earth's water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the ground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	37
Atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on Earth's ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, N2O) potentially causing climate change.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	38
A major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	39
A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	0
The control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	1
Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	2
To return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	3
However, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	4
These reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	5
This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	6
As <link> illustrates, sodium (Na) only has one electron in its outer electron shell.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	7
In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	8
"This type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means ""to put together while losing water."""	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	9
Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	0
Each photosystem is serviced by the light-harvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300 – 400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	1
"The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or ""packet"" of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state."	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	2
Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	3
To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	4
A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	5
"However, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a ""I"" or a ""II."""	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	6
Thus, meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	7
Meiosis II, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	8
Notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_202.deft	0
Scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called binomial nomenclature.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_202.deft	1

Current is the flow of charge, and charge is conserved; thus, whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_101.deft	9
Thinking of the molecules as many slits, analogous to those for the oscillating ropes, we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_101.deft	10
The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an EM wave (see <link>).	1	task_1_t3_physics_2_101.deft	11
The slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light.	1	task_1_t3_physics_2_101.deft	12
The bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the individual waves composing the ray.	1	task_1_t3_physics_2_101.deft	13
But baryons have B = +1 B = +1 if they are antimatter.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	0
The conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics, where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	1
That rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	2

Originally, three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then-known mesons and baryons.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	4
These quark flavors are named up (u), down (d), and strange (s).	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	5
Color is consistent with all observations and is now widely accepted.	0	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	6
Quark theory including color is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), also named by Gell-Mann.	1	task_1_t3_physics_2_202.deft	7
It's easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as the fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	0
DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	2
In each chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	3
A single gene may have multiple possible variations, or alleles.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	5
Between signals, the neuron membrane's potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	6
Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates (i.e., a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	7
Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge. In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the cell.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_0.deft	8
The ear can be separated into multiple sections.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	0
The outer ear includes the pinna, which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads, the auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane, or eardrum.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	1
The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles, which are named the malleus (or hammer), incus (or anvil), and the stapes (or stirrup).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	2
As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	3
As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates hair cells, which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	4
The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	5
When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (the tone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	6
Thus, the neutral stimulus became the conditioned stimulus (CS), which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned stimulus.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	7
Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants' footsteps.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	8
As mentioned earlier, the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	9
Like the amygdala, research has demonstrated that hippocampal structure and function are linked to a variety of mood and anxiety disorders.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	10
There are three types of encoding.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	11
The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	12
It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize words.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	13
In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storage of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	14
It is very brief storage — up to a couple of seconds.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	15
Then, information in short-term memory goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or close a web browser).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	16
This step of rehearsal, the conscious repetition of information to be remembered, to move STM into long-term memory is called memory consolidation.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	17
Lashley did not find evidence of the engram, and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze, regardless of the size or location of the lesion.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	18
Based on his creation of lesions and the animals' reaction, he formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis: if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged, another part of the same area can take over that memory function (Lashley, 1950).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	19
Although Lashley's early work did not confirm the existence of the engram, modern psychologists are making progress locating it.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	20

He disagreed, however, with Skinner's strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	23
He presented a social-cognitive theory of personality that emphasizes both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	24
In social-cognitive theory, the concepts of reciprocal determinism, observational learning, and self-efficacy all play a part in personality development.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	25
Social psychology examines how people affect one another, and it looks at the power of the situation.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_202.deft	0
Social psychologists assert that an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are very much influenced by social situations.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_202.deft	1
In individual therapy, also known as individual psychotherapy or individual counseling, the client and clinician meet one-on-one (usually from 45 minutes to 1 hour).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_202.deft	2
These meetings typically occur weekly or every other week, and sessions are conducted in a confidential and caring environment (<link>).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_202.deft	3
The main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms (APA, 2013).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_303.deft	0
A hallucination is a perceptual experience that occurs in the absence of external stimulation.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_303.deft	1
Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) occur in roughly two-thirds of patients with schizophrenia and are by far the most common form of hallucination (Andreasen, 1987).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_303.deft	2
A characteristic like cleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	0
"In this example, we will call the gene for cleft chin ""B"" and the gene for smooth chin ""b."" Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele."	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	1
When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to be homozygous for that allele.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	2
When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to be heterozygous.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	3
For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	4
Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	5
What type of chin will their child have?	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_0.deft	6
Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_101.deft	0
Now we turn to the second type of associative learning, operant conditioning.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_101.deft	1

Each time the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_101.deft	3
When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior, it is called continuous reinforcement.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_101.deft	4
This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_101.deft	5

Cluster B disorders include antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_303.deft	1
People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly dramatic, highly emotional, and erratic.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_303.deft	2
According to the DSM-5, the individual with antisocial personality disorder (sometimes referred to as psychopathy) shows no regard at all for other people's rights or feelings.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_1_303.deft	3
This lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedly performing illegal acts, lying to or conning others, impulsivity and recklessness, irritability and aggressiveness toward others, and failure to act in a responsible way (e.g., leaving debts unpaid) (APA, 2013).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_1_303.deft	4
Much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_0.deft	4
Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_0.deft	5
In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_0.deft	6
Our ability to perceive spatial relationships in three-dimensional (3-D) space is known as depth perception.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	0

Many others begin to suffer from conductive hearing loss because of age, genetic predisposition, or environmental effects, including exposure to extreme noise (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in <link>), certain illnesses (such as measles or mumps), or damage due to toxins (such as those found in certain solvents and metals).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	3
Molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on our tongue and in our mouth and throat.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	4
Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud (<link>).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	5
Taste buds have a life cycle of ten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue wo n't have any long-term effect; they just grow right back.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	6
Robert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence, which he titled the triarchic theory of intelligence because it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts (Sternberg, 1988): practical, creative, and analytical intelligence (<link>).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	7
In these cultures, the importance of the group supersedes the importance of individual achievement.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_101.deft	8

Consider, for example, a child's physical growth: adding inches to her height year by year.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	0
In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuous believe that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	1
With this type of development, the change is more sudden, such as an infant's ability to conceive object permanence.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	2
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development (<link>).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	3

An especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (Petty&Cacioppo, 1986).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	7
The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitude change approach — that is, features of the source of the persuasive message, contents of the message, and characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	8
According to the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a persuasive message: central and peripheral (<link>).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	9
In normative social influence, people conform to the group norm to fit in, to feel good, and to be accepted by the group.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	10
However, with informational social influence, people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information, particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	11
People often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	12
These judgments and expectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	13
Typically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_202.deft	14
Other delusions include the belief that one's thoughts are being removed (thought withdrawal) or thoughts have been placed inside one's head (thought insertion).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	0
Another type of delusion is somatic delusion, which is the belief that something highly abnormal is happening to one's body (e.g., that one's kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	1
People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience thoughts and urges that are intrusive and unwanted (obsessions) and/or the need to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions).	1	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	2
A person with this disorder might, for example, spend hours each day washing his hands or constantly checking and rechecking to make sure that a stove, faucet, or light has been turned off.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	3
Specific phobias are common; in the United States, around 12.5% of the population will meet the criteria for a specific phobia at some point in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	4
One type of phobia, agoraphobia, is listed in the DSM-5 as a separate anxiety disorder.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_2_303.deft	5

It should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground.	0	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	0
That ground can be divided into two parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole.	1	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	1
It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports.	0	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	2
Command economies are very different.	0	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	3
In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class.	1	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	4
Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in <link>, for the pharaohs.	0	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	5
Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price.	1	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	6
Demand is based on needs and wants — a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist's perspective they are the same thing.	0	task_1_t5_economic_0_0.deft	7

If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life.	0	task_1_t5_economic_1_0.deft	0
Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available.	1	task_1_t5_economic_1_0.deft	1
Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply.	0	task_1_t5_economic_1_0.deft	2

An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties; for example, a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary.	1	task_1_t5_economic_1_101.deft	7
In financial capital markets, banks are an example of a financial intermediary — that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank.	1	task_1_t5_economic_1_101.deft	8
When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet.	0	task_1_t5_economic_1_101.deft	9
A similar pattern often operates within businesses.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	0
"In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its ""core competency"") is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products."	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	1
Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	2
But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	3
Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government's approval.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	4
Whatever the firm's quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	5
As explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are often sunk costs that can not be recouped.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	6
In thinking about what to do next, sunk costs should typically be ignored, since this spending has already been made and can not be changed.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_0.deft	7

Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality and poverty.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	0
Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income — called the poverty line — that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	1
Income inequality compares the share of the total income (or wealth) in society that is received by different groups; for example, comparing the share of income received by the top 10% to the share of income received by the bottom 10%.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	2
The earned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	3

A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	9
A corporate bond is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	10
The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds; stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	11
Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the liquidity of the investment, which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	12

Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	7
Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	8
The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	9
Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	10
Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as shown in <link>.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	11
In the neoclassical model, the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) is determined by real economic factors.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	12
<link> also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	13
In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	14
Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	15
Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	16
However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	17
There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	18
For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long-term productivity of a country.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	19
These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	20
A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	21
If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	22
When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as crowding out.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	23
To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	24
The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	25
Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	26
You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	27
For unemployment caused by a recession, the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	28
The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase aggregate demand.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	29
In a recession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in interest rates.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	30
With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	31
However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	32
During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	33
In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	34

High-income countries of the world — primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union, and Japan — subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about$ 360 billion per year.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_303.deft	0
By contrast, the total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to the poor countries of the world is about$ 70 billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_303.deft	1
