Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	0
The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	1
It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	2
At its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	3
Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	4
Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	5
Electron Orbitals	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	6
Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	7
They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in electron orbitals.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	8
These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	9
An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	10
A base provides either hydroxide ions (OH –) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	11
In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	12
The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	13
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70 – 90 nucleotides long.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	14
It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	15
A prokaryote is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	16
We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	17
Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	18
Other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: The membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_0.deft	19
Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	0

In the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	4
In the punctuated equilibrium model, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward (<link>).	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	5
Scientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different species of prokaryotes when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	6
This occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species, which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	7
The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	8
These drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT, inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host's metabolism.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	9
This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many HIV-infected individuals.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	10
Other viruses induce hypoplasia, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	11
Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	12
Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	13
Archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	14
In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	15
The DNA transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a hybrid, containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	16

A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	20
A single unbranched vein — a bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloem — runs through the center of the leaf.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	21
Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches, or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_202.deft	22
As illustrated in <link>, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_303.deft	0
Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_303.deft	1
Following fertilization of the egg, the ovule grows into a seed.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_303.deft	2
The surrounding tissues of the ovary thicken, developing into a fruit that will protect the seed and often ensure its dispersal over a wide geographic range.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_303.deft	3
"Not all fruits develop from an ovary; such structures are ""false fruits."""	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_303.deft	4

Cytokine Release Effect	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	0
The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	1
A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	2
At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they produce.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	3
NK cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence, and the NK cell moves on.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	4
After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	5
Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	6
An antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	7
Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	8
Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	9
This can occur either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	10
Humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	11
The oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact with the ovaries.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	12
The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like projections called fimbriae, illustrated in <link> b.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	13
FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in <link>.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	14

Many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	16
Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline (<link>).	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	17
As the wind pushes ocean waters offshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	18
Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity).	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	19
Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	20
In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	21
These fishes can feed on coral, the cryptofauna (invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	22
In addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, or planktivores.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	23
"Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or ""flesh eaters."""	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	24
Herbivores eat plant material, and planktivores eat plankton.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	25
Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	26
This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	27
The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection).	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	28
To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	29
In another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	30

Symbiosis	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	32
Symbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations.	1	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	33
Most scientists accept this definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the interaction.	0	task_1_t1_biology_0_606.deft	34
The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_101.deft	0
As you have learned, mitosis is the part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_101.deft	1
For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	0
Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	1
Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	2
Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	3
Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	4
This term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	5
Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	6

Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	9
Some dinoflagellates generate light, called bioluminescence, when they are jarred or stressed.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	12
Large numbers of marine dinoflagellates (billions or trillions of cells per wave) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	13
Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	14
Most fungi produce a large number of spores, which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	15
Like bacteria, fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	16
Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	17
Most members live on land, with a few aquatic exceptions.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	18
They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold. Reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	19
Some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_202.deft	20
The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	0
A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	1
The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	2
Many societies eat almost exclusively vegetarian fare and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	3
A few crops (rice, wheat, and potatoes) dominate the agricultural landscape.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_303.deft	4

Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	0
The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	1
The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like projections called the villi.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	2
Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	3
Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	4
Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_404.deft	5
When blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	0
Cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	1
Renin, an enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_505.deft	2
The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water (<link>).	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	0
These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	1
In wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	2
This model also allows for the population of a negative population growth, or a population decline.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	3
This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (K-N) / K is negative).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	4
A graph of this equation yields an S-shaped curve (<link>), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	5
There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	6
Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	7

Equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	9
In ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	10
In many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton), which are called primary producers.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	11
The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary consumers.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	12
Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	13
For example, in the English Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g / m2 (grams per meter squared), while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g / m2.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	14
The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy.	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	15
The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity.	1	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	16
An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_1_606.deft	17
While research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	0
Penicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	1
Review articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive reference sections.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	2
These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	3
Some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable atomic configuration (lower level of potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	4
Radioactive decay (carbon-14 decaying to eventually become nitrogen-14) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom's nucleus releases radiation. Evolution Connection	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	5
Atoms that chemically react and bond to each other form molecules.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	6
Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	7
Logically, when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	8
Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and InteractionsAnother way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	9
These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	10
During this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	11
A covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is known as a glycosidic bond (<link>).	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	12
Glycosidic bonds (also called glycosidic linkages) can be of the alpha or the beta type.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	13
Enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	14
Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_0.deft	15
The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (<link>).	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	0
During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	1
During the mitotic phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_101.deft	2
Viruses are acellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_202.deft	0

Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum: the Anthophyta.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	0
Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which means that they originate from a single ancestor.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	1
Pollen and seed were innovative structures that allowed seed plants to break their dependence on water for reproduction and development of the embryo, and to conquer dry land.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	2
The pollen grains are the male gametophytes, which contain the sperm (gametes) of the plant.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	3
The small haploid (1n) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation (drying out) and mechanical damage.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	4
"The current understanding of evolutionary relationships between animal, or Metazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between ""true"" animals with true differentiated tissues, called Eumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues (such as the sponges), called Parazoa."	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	5
Both Parazoa and Eumetazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembles the modern-day protists called choanoflagellates.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	6
Pinacocytes, which are epithelial-like cells, form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly-like substance called mesohyl.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	7
Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen-like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	8

Some species of salamanders and all caecilians are functionally limbless; their limbs are vestigial.	0	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	13
An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands that keep the skin moist; thus, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment can take place through it (cutaneous respiration).	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	14
Additional characteristics of amphibians include pedicellate teeth — teeth in which the root and crown are calcified, separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue — and a papilla amphibiorum and papilla basilaris, structures of the inner ear that are sensitive to frequencies below and above 10,00 hertz, respectively.	1	task_1_t1_biology_2_303.deft	15

An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and, thus, is jet black.	1	task_1_t3_physics_1_101.deft	16
Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies, and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation.	1	task_1_t3_physics_1_101.deft	17
It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T4, T4, the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body, and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures.	0	task_1_t3_physics_1_101.deft	18

Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	2
This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as <link> illustrates.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	3
They tend to be simpler than instincts, involve the activity of specific body parts and systems (e.g., the knee-jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light), and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system (e.g., the spinal cord and the medulla).	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	4
In contrast, instincts are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events, such as aging and the change of seasons.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	5
They are more complex patterns of behavior, involve movement of the organism as a whole (e.g., sexual activity and migration), and involve higher brain centers.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	6
Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let's take a look at some of the general processes involved.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	7
In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	8

Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in her own capability to complete a task, which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task.	1	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	12
Albert Bandura (1994) theorized that an individual's sense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior.	0	task_1_t4_psychology_0_101.deft	13

The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	13
If a country's exports are larger than its imports, then a country is said to have a trade surplus.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	14
In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as shown in <link>.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	15
To avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_101.deft	16

<link> illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	11
The original equilibrium occurs at E0, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	12
The new equilibrium (E1) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92.	0	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	13
Each year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the standardized employment budget — that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes.	1	task_1_t5_economic_2_202.deft	14
